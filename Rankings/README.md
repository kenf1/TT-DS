# Table Tennis (TT) Project

A collection of Data Science project(s) centered around a central theme: the exciting and fast-paced sport of **Table Tennis**. As a Table Tennis fan and player, I am passionate about keeping up with the sport and using data-driven insights to improve my table tennis _(and Data Science!)_ techniques.

## Current Projects

1. **ITTF Rankings** - A Python script to web scrape, tidy, and store ITTF rankings data inside a comma-separated-value (.csv) file. Each scraped dataset will be saved inside a separate .csv file with the title following a format of `Competition Type` + `Year` + `Week`.
